    "## Introduction / Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "With this project we want to analyse our personal network traffic. We first want to understand general information about our network, namely the used protocols, dns servers, encryption distribution and ethertypes which are mainly used by our clients. Further, we want to analyse the sources and destinations of our requests and which devices sent the most data. Lastly, we want to inspect the collected data by searching for suspicious network traffic. To do so we want to investigate the traffic of used IoT devices and see how much / which data they share. Moreover, we will take a look at suspicious destinations to see where our data is shared to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup of Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hardware setup included a Raspberry Pi which was setup as a Wifi access point and collected the network traffic using `tcpdump`. The Raspberry Pi was then connected to our local router providing access to the internet. All of us were using another access point and additional wired lan directly connected to the router. Therefore, the Raspberry Pi could not collect the whole traffic from our homes, but only a representive part of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To collect the data we used the following tcpdump command: `tcpdump -i eth0 -G 86400  -w dumps/%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M_dump.pcap -Z root`. We captured the whole traffic which is going through the eth0 interface, so through the LAN port of the Raspberry Pi. We saved the collected dumps into daily chunks which were named after the current date. The root flag was necessary to make sure that the capturing restarted daily. \n",

    "## Metrics on how much data was collected\n",

    "How many devices , how much data\n",
